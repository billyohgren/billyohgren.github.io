## What?
Symbolic8 is an app that makes it super easy to symbolicate iOS crash logs on Mac OSX.

## Why?
A friend of mine asked me if I knew how to symbolicate crash logs and instead of replying with a answer I wrote a simple app :)

## How?

1. Download [this zip archive](https://github.com/billyohgren/billyohgren.github.io/blob/master/files/symbolic8/Symbolic8-alpha.zip?raw=true)
2. Unarchive it.
3. Start the app (make sure that you can open apps that haven't been signed)
4. Browse and select the path to your: .App, .dSYM and .crash file and hit Symbolicate.
5. Name your symbolicated crash and click ok.
6. Good luck with fixing that crash!

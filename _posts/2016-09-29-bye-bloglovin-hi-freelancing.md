It's been about 4 years since I first met with the founders of Bloglovin and later on decided to join the company as their first iOS developer.

The journey with this company is something I'll never forget. Seeing a company going from 6 people in a small office in Stockholm to about 30 or so people in New York have tought me a lot of great things.

Thank you for all these years Bloglovers!

Since September 1st I'm working as a freelancing iOS developer based in Stockholm and my first client is Tiptapp, a "getting rid of things app".

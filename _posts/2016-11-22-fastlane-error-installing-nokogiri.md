### Problem
A couple of days ago I was about to install fastlane on my laptop to start automate my app store deploys.
It didn't take long before I was hit with the first error:

"ERROR:  Error installing nokogiri:
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension."

### Solution
I solved this by with the following 3 steps:
* ``xcode-select --install``
* ``sudo gem install nokogiri -v '1.6.8' -- --use-system-libraries=true --with-xml2-include=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk/usr/include/libxml2``
* ``sudo gem install fastlane --verbose``

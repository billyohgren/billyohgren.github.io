This is one of (hopefully) many blog posts about creating your first web project. My colleague G asked me one day how to get started in doing that, and I thought it would be fun to guide him through my process of having a vague idea and turning it into a web site.

Since there will be a lot of steps I need to split it up into several parts. This is my idea of what needs to be done when creating something that lives on the world wide web:

* What’s the project/site about?
* Domain name
* Design
* Content
* Code 
* Hosting
* SEO/Marketing
* Social Media
* Potential revenue sources
* ??
* Profit!

I will try my best to describe in depth how I tackle every bullet in the list above. And there’s a disclaimer: This is not necessary the best or the most optimised way in doing things, it’s just how I work with a new project. This is not ment for someone who would like to “start a startup” even though I think a startup should be born from a product and not by starting a company and later on come up with a product, and then try to find product market fit.
